            <h3>What are the benefits of using CSS?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element
                    once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.</li>
                <li>The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One
                    instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li>
                <li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed</li>
                <li>Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a
                    change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.</li>
                <li>It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.</li>
                <li>It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.</li>
                <li>CSS changes are device friendly. With people employing a batch of various range of smart devices to
                    access websites over the web, thereâ€™s a requirement for responsive web design.</li>
                <li>It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within the position of web
                    elements who are there on the page.</li>
                <li>These bandwidth savings are substantial figures of insignificant tags that are indistinct from a
                    mess of pages.</li>
                <li>Easy for the user to customize the online page</li>
                <li>It reduces the file transfer size.</li>

            <h3>What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among web browsers.</li>
                <li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to
                    test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
                <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
                <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change
                    affects on all the browsers.</li>
                <li>The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of
                    CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
                <li>Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
                <li>CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.</li>
                <li>There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.</li>
                <li>There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.</li>

                <li><b>Box Model:</b> The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that defines the layout of elements.
                    It consists of content, padding, border, and margin.</li>
                <li><b>Flexbox and Grid:</b> These are layout models that allow for more complex and responsive designs.

            <h3>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element. In simple word, you can
                    say that it specifies the clarity of the image.</li>
                <li>opacity applies to the element as a whole, including its contents, even though the value is not
                    inherited by child elements. Thus, the element and its children all have the same opacity relative
                    to the element's background, even if they have different opacities relative to one another.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>
            <h3>How can the background color of an element be changed?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property.Set it to the color name or
                    code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML
                    element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.</li>
                <li>For Ex:-
                    <pre class="bg">h1{background-color: blueviolet}</pre>

        <li>
            <h3>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the
                    repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background
                    image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be
                    repeated or not.
                </li>
                <li>we will make use of the repeat-x to repeat the image in the horizontal direction.</li>
                <li>we will make use of the repeat-y to repeat the image in the vertical direction.</li>
                <p>Syntax</p>
                <p>You have to first give the url of a image. Then add this property.</p>
                <pre>
                    {
                    background-repeat: repeat| repeat-x |

            <h3>What is the use of the background-position property?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.</li>
                <li>By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both
                    vertically and horizontally.</li>
                <li>The background-position property can take various values, specifying the horizontal and vertical
                    positions. The values can be expressed in pixels, percentages, or keywords like left top , left
                    center etc .</li>
                <li>the background-image property sets the image that you want to use as the background, and
                    background-position:center the background image both horizontally and vertically within the element.
                </li>
                <li>Here are some common values for the background-position property:
                    <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                        <li>center</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image will scroll along with the
                    rest of the elements on the page when the user slides the scroll-bar in the browser or whether the
                    image will stay fixed to the page. The background-attachment property can either be set to scroll or
                    fixed.</li>
                <li>scroll: The default value. The background image scrolls with the content.</li>
                <li>fixed: The background image remains fixed in the viewport as the content scrolls. It doesn't move

                <li>It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS,
                    and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase</li>
                <li>Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.</li>

            <h3>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use
                    Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can
                    embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS
                    from our HTML. </li>
                <li><b>Inline CSS:</b> You can add CSS rules directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
                    <p>Example: <br>
                    <pre
                        style="color:blueviolet ;">&lt;p style ="color: red ;"&gt; This is a blueviolet para."&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Internal CSS:</b> You can define CSS rules in the head section of an HTML document using the tag.
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre>
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;style&gt;p {color: darkslateblue;}&lt;/style&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
                    </pre>
                    <p class="Internal">CSS applied in this para is defined in head tag </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>External CSS:</b> You can define CSS rules in a separate file and link it to the HTML document
                    using the &lt;link&gt; tag.
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <pre>
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;

            <h3>What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Embedded stylesheets, also known as internal stylesheets, involve placing the CSS styles directly
                    within the HTML document.</li>
                <li>This is done using the &lt;style&gt; element within the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document.
                </li>
                <li>The styles specified within the &lt;style&gt; tags apply to the elements within that particular HTML
                    document.Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique style
                    requirements from the rest of the documents in your project.</li>

            <h3>What are the external style sheets?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>External CSS:</b> You can define CSS rules in a separate file and link it to the HTML document
                    using the &lt;link&gt; tag.
                <li>This is done by creating a separate CSS file that contains all the styles that need to be used on a
                    website.</li>
                <li>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one
                    file.</li>
                <li>Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the &lt;link&gt;
                    element, inside the head section</li>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre>
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css&gt;
